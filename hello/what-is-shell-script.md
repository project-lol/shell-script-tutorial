# what is shell script \n

This script first specifies the path to the file that it wants to read using the file_path variable.
It then uses the $(<"$file_path") syntax to read the contents of the file into the file_contents variable.
Finally, it prints the contents of the file_contents variable using the echo command.

Note that the $(<"$file_path") syntax is a shorthand way to read the contents of a file.
It is equivalent to using the cat command, like this: file_contents=$(cat "$file_path").
However, the $(<) syntax is faster and more efficient for reading the contents of a file.

Also, keep in mind that if the file contains special characters or newlines,
the contents may not be stored correctly in the variable.
In such cases, you may need to use additional commands or options to handle the contents of the file.
